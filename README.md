WDI Seattle Project One


This is my first project for GA WDI. It is a podcatcher that grabs audio files based on search terms and the amount of time you have to listen. I created this app in one week using npr's api and wimpy player. I have many more features I'd like to add including video and articles and more customizable search options and settings. 

Enjoy!
