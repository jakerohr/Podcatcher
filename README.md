WDI Seattle Project One


This is my first project for GA WDI. It is a podcatcher that grabs audio files based on search terms and the amount of time you have to listen.


#Technologies used include: express, sequelize, bcrypt, node and postgres.

#I created this app in one week using npr's api and wimpy player. My sidebar was inspired by one created by maridlcrmn.

I have many more features I'd like to add including video and articles and more customizable search options and settings.

Enjoy!
